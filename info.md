Hello! You may have found yourself on this page after familarizing yourself with our open source mouse wheel. If you use this wheel in your projects, please cite our paper! 

Feel free to fork and modifiy for your purposes. 

This wheel has several features that differentiate it from standard voluntary exercise. 
  1. it can be locked at distance or time milestones.
  2. it tracks distance ran
  3. it's (relatively) free
  

The two .ino files are for controlling the wheel based on distance or time.
You will need to install the following libraries to program your wheel 
    1. U8g2
    2. U8x8
    3. Servo 
    4. SPI
    5. Wire
If you are using an Arduino Nano Clone, be sure to install your appropriate drivers

Also included are files to print the wheel on a 3d printer. They are the provided as .STL files.

Hardware required for assambly:
1. Arduino Nano (or a nano clone) (1)
2. SG90 micro servo (1)
3. 6 mm D shaft (1)
4. 0.96 inch 128x64 SSD1306 OLED screeen (1)
5. KY003 hall effect sensor (1)
